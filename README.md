I've really struggled with Javascript this past week and this project was no exception.

My first mistake in this project was spending too much time on fiddlening with the html and css, and I ended up chaning the structure a few times. 

I only have 2 blocks of Javascript code. I wanted to add a few more, but I wasn't able to get them to work, so I had to delete them. One thing I was trying to do was add the anchor tags linking to the other pages in the string that appears when clicking the button, but I couldn't figure out how to do that... so I just had to place the links below the buttons. Looks a bit weird but oh well.

I added a CSS "animation" on the image, but didn't know how to control it with JS.

Defintiely need to practice all of this more D:
